#QTL Text Analysis Project 2 - COMS_579

This project extends the work from Project 1 by applying advanced language models to analyze animal QTL-related texts. It explores and compares different embedding techniques including:

BERT Embeddings with Cosine Similarity (bert_nd_grove_2.ipynb)

GloVe Embedding with Similarity Metrics (GloVe_T1.ipynb)

Manual Rule-based Phrase Matching (M1.4.ipynb)

Each method aims to extract and match QTL-relevant traits from the text using different NLP techniques.

ðŸ”§ Setup
Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed, along with Jupyter and the required libraries:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/qtl_text_analysis_project2.git
cd qtl_text_analysis_project2
pip install -r requirements.txt
ðŸš€ Execution Instructions
1. BERT-based Embedding and Similarity Matching
   
jupyter notebook bert_nd_grove_2.ipynb
This notebook uses pre-trained BERT to compute sentence embeddings and evaluates similarity between extracted phrases and dictionary terms.

3. GloVe-based Trait Matching

jupyter notebook GloVe_T1.ipynb
This method uses pre-trained GloVe vectors to represent text and compute cosine similarity with trait terms.

4. Manual Trait Phrase Matching

jupyter notebook M1.4.ipynb
This rule-based approach manually searches for trait phrases within the text corpus using string patterns and keyword matching.

ðŸ“Š Results
The comparative analysis of trait extraction methods and their performance is documented in 579_Project_2_Report.pdf.

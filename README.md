# QTL Text Analysis Project 2 - COMS 579

This project extends the work from Project 1 by applying advanced language models to analyze animal QTL-related texts. It explores and compares different embedding techniques including:

- **BERT Embeddings with Cosine Similarity** (`bert_nd_grove_2.ipynb`)
- **GloVe Embedding with Similarity Metrics** (`GloVe_T1.ipynb`)
- **Manual Rule-based Phrase Matching** (`M1.4.ipynb`)

Each method aims to extract and match QTL-relevant traits from the text using different NLP techniques.

## ðŸ”§ Setup

Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed, along with Jupyter and the required libraries:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/qtl_text_analysis_project2.git
cd qtl_text_analysis_project2
```

---

## ðŸš€ Execution Instructions

### 1. BERT-based Embedding and Similarity Matching

```bash
jupyter notebook bert_nd_grove_2.ipynb
```

This notebook uses pre-trained BERT to compute sentence embeddings and evaluates similarity between extracted phrases and dictionary terms.

---

### 2. GloVe-based Trait Matching

```bash
jupyter notebook GloVe_T1.ipynb
```

This method uses pre-trained GloVe vectors to represent text and compute cosine similarity with trait terms.

---

### 3. Manual Trait Phrase Matching

```bash
jupyter notebook M1.4.ipynb
```

This rule-based approach manually searches for trait phrases within the text corpus using string patterns and keyword matching.

## ðŸ“Š Results

The comparative analysis of trait extraction methods and their performance is documented in `579_Project_2_Report.pdf`.
